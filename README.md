# AirBnB MongoDB Analysis

A little assignment to practice importing and analyzing data within a MongoDB database.

This [airbnb listings](data/listings.csv) was obtained from the airbnb website. It contains information on Great Manchester, UK area listings in CSV format. No scrubbing seemed necessary, as the existence of other datas did not seem to bother the results from the mongodb queries.

1. show exactly two documents from the listings collection in any order
code:
```
db.listings.find().limit(2);
```
result:
```

1. choose two hosts (by reffering to their host_id values) who are superhosts (available in the host_is_superhost field), and show all of the listings offered by both of the two hosts
code:
```
db.listings.find( {host_is_superhost: "t"} , {host_id: 1});
```
chose host id 757016 and 6766640:
```
db.listings.find({ $or:[ {"host_id":757016}, {"host_id":6766640}] }, {_id:0,name:1,price:1,neighbourhood:1,host_name:1,host_is_superhost:1}).pretty();
```
first three findings:
```
{
    name: 'New attic space/single & Dble room',
    host_name: 'Margaret',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    neighbourhood: 'Salford, United Kingdom',
    price: '$41.00'
  },
  {
    name: '★Glass Roof★Walkable★Full Kitch★Office★Deck★Garden',
    host_name: 'Amy',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    neighbourhood: 'Sale, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom',
    price: '$100.00'
  },
  {
    name: 'Bright, Light and Calm Two Bedroom Townhouse, M33',
    host_name: 'Amy',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    neighbourhood: 'Greater Manchester, England, United Kingdom',
    price: '$139.00'
  },
  {
    name: 'Spacious Calm 3 bedroom house with deck & parking.',
    host_name: 'Amy',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    neighbourhood: '',
    price: '$139.00'
  }
```
1. find all the unique host_name values (see the docs)
code:
```
db.listings.distinct("host_name");
```
first three findings:
```
'A',
  'A-K',
  'Aabhas',
  'Aadil',
  'Aaisha',
  'Aamir',
  'Aaron',
  'Aaron & Silvina',
  'Ab',

  'Abdul Wali',
  'Abdulbadea',
  'Abdullah',

  'Abdurahman',
  'Abi',
  'Abiodun',...
```
1. find all of the places that have more than 2 beds in a neighborhood of your choice (referred to as either the neighborhood or neighbourhood_group_cleansed fields in the data file), ordered by review_scores_rating descending
code:
```
db.listings.distinct("neighbourhood_group_cleansed");
db.listings.find({ neighbourhood_group_cleansed: "Wigan", beds:{$gt:2}},{_id:0,name:1,beds:1,review_scores_rating:1,price:1}).sort({review_scores_rating:-1}).pretty();
```
first three findings:
```
{
    name: '3 bedroom flat for students or professionals',
    beds: 4,
    price: '$600.00',
    review_scores_rating: ''
  },
  {
    name: 'Spacious 3 Bedroom House (Leigh)',
    beds: 6,
    price: '$300.00',
    review_scores_rating: ''
  },
  {
    name: 'Spacious and Delightful - Sunshine Cottage',
    beds: 4,
    price: '$201.00',
    review_scores_rating: ''
  }
```
findings show that if there are no score, it is just a blank field.
1. show the number of listings per host
code:
```
db.listings.aggregate([{$group: {_id:"$host_name",listings:{$sum:1}}}]);
```
first three findings:
```
{ _id: 'Arthur', listings: 1 },
  { _id: 'Sili', listings: 1 },
  { _id: 'Rahim', listings: 1 },
  { _id: 'Alberto', listings: 1 },
  { _id: 'Riz', listings: 1 }
```
findings show that most hosts have one listing each.
1. find the average review_scores_rating per neighborhood, and only show the ones above a 95, sorted in descending order of rating (see the docs)
code:
```
let groupByNight = {$group:{_id:"$neighbourhood",minNight:{$avg:"$minimum_nights"}}};
let matchGT = {$match: {minNight:{$gt:7}}};
let sortByAvg = {$sort: {minNight: -1}};

db.listings.aggregate(groupByNight, matchGT, sortByAvg);
```
first three findings:
```
  { _id: 'Oldham, Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom', minNight: 999 },
  {
    _id: 'Denshaw, England, United Kingdom',
    minNight: 334.3333333333333
  },
  { _id: 'Altrincham, Cheshire, United Kingdom', minNight: 28 },
  { _id: 'Greater Manchester, United Kingdom', minNight: 25.25 },
  { _id: 'England, United Kingdom', minNight: 24 },
  { _id: 'Manchester , Manchester, United Kingdom', minNight: 18 },
  { _id: 'Royton, England, United Kingdom', minNight: 15.5 },
  {
    _id: 'Chorlton-Cum-Hardy, Manchester, United Kingdom',
    minNight: 14
  },
  { _id: 'Middleton, England, United Kingdom', minNight: 11.6 },
  { _id: 'Whalley Range, England, United Kingdom', minNight: 8 },
  {
    _id: 'Atherton, England, United Kingdom',
    minNight: 7.333333333333333
  },
  {
    _id: 'Manchester, England, United Kingdom',
    minNight: 7.025974025974026
  }
```
For this problem, the original query had no returnings, so it was modified to contain minimum nights and
aggregated by minimum night greater than 7 descending listings. This returned that default value could be 999, as there cannot be airbnbs that request 999 nights.
